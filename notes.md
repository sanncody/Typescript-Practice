# What is Typescript?

Typescript is Javascript with syntax for types.

# Why Typescript?

- Avoid bugs in the development.

- Increase the development speed.

- Additional Features like interfaces, enums, property modifiers, etc., which are not present in Javascript.


## Note

We cannot run typescript in production as after writing typescript code, it gets compiled in JS and then run in production.
